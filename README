IMPORTANT: Use only with firmware 1.2.x (files from editor 1.2.4)

Loading presets to the QuNeo
============================

Use the presets in the presets_1.2.3 subdirectory, or make your own (e.g. with File/Export from another editor).
To generate a SysEx file, e.g. from QuNeo_FactoryPresets.json second preset (zero-based so index is 1):

$ python quneo-linux.py --output example.syx preset --preset_file presets_1.2.3/QuNeo_FactoryPresets.json --in 1

You will see the following output:

NOTE: No device given, will write to file example.syx
NOTE: No output preset defined, using 0.
Processing preset: "Drum E2-G3"
Stored as preset 0
Preset size 1515 bytes.
Wrote to example.syx

The file "example.syx" was created, it also contains a section to load the
preset. Thus when loading the preset it will:
  1. overwrite preset number 0
  2. refresh QuNeo internally to make the new preset active

To load it to the QuNeo, give a proper --device (e.g. /dev/snd/midiC2D0), or do
something like this:

Connect the QuNeo.

cat output.syx > /dev/snd/midiC2D0

That's it! Your new preset is in the QuNeo.

To change the target preset, use a parameter such as "--out 5".


To get help
===========

python quneo-linux.py debug --help
python quneo-linux.py preset --help


Quick checking your presets
===========================

To check/debug your presets, a simple scanner tool called midiscan.py is
provided:

python midiscan.py /dev/snd/midiC2D0

Then press buttons on the QuNeo.
NOTE: The scanner is just a very simple tool.

Press CTRL-C to exit the midiscan.py.

Example output after loading the firmware preset #16:

Using ALSA MIDI device /dev/snd/midiC2D0
Hit ctrl-C to stop

[1] Note On: note=12 velocity=118
[1] Note Off: note=12 velocity=0
[1] Note On: note=13 velocity=118
[1] Note Off: note=13 velocity=0
[1] Note On: note=14 velocity=99
[1] Note Off: note=14 velocity=0
...

You can also run the midiscan.py while sending other commands, such as Sysex.
