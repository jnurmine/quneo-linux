Loading presets to the QuNeo
============================

First, you need a single preset in json format.
This can be done with the Windows QuNeo Editor. You need to run it under Wine.

Use File/Export to export a preset to a file (e.g. "example.json").

To generate a SysEx file:

python json2syx.py --preset_file example.json --num 1

This will create, by default, a file called "preset.syx".
The file also contains the preset refresh part.
Thus when loading the preset it will:
  1. overwrite preset number 1
  2. refresh QuNeo internally to make the new preset active

To load it to the QuNeo, do something like this:

Connect the QuNeo.

cat output.syx > /dev/snd/midiC2D0

That's it! Your new preset is in the QuNeo.

Quick checking your presets
===========================

To check/debug your presets, a simple scanner tool called midiscan.py is
provided:

python midiscan.py /dev/snd/midiC2D0

Then press buttons on the QuNeo. NOTE: The scanner is just a very simple tool.

Press CTRL-C to exit the midiscan.py.

Example output after loading the firmware preset #16:

Using ALSA MIDI device /dev/snd/midiC2D0
Hit ctrl-C to stop

[1] Note On: note=12 velocity=118
[1] Note Off: note=12 velocity=0
[1] Note On: note=13 velocity=118
[1] Note Off: note=13 velocity=0
[1] Note On: note=14 velocity=99
[1] Note Off: note=14 velocity=0
...

In the future there will hopefully be a proper editor for Linux.

Cheers!
